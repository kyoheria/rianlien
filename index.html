                            <p>my:ID is a web-based data visualization platform exploring the complexity of human identity. The project visualizes how people around me see and understand the basic American identity labels, and expresses how and why those labels are important to me. The platform is based on user-submitted data from 18 individuals, age 18 TO 19, transforming the spectrum of common identity terms into an accessible data visualisation.</p>
                            <p>This project started as my way to explain how I think about my identity and whole connection to people who made me who I am. As an Asian, non-straight woman who grew up half in the USA and half in Japan, it is very hard for my friends and family in Japan to understand my friends or me. Furthermore, it is very hard for me to understand why they can’t.  This project has become a tool for me to explain how my friendships have influenced the way I see gender, sexuality, and identity, beyond normative labels.It has also helped me reconnect with many people, and talk with them about their identity.I am very interested in how technology, design, and society might capture human identity in different ways.</p>

                            <p>In life there are moments where you try to fit in, and as a result you aren’t really you anymore.</In>/p>
                            <p>The only way out is hidden in you. You are the key.</p>
                            <p>.../Soft and Squishy is an interactive screen-based installation that evokes a feeling of not belonging through a jelly-like character that transforms into other creatures in the sea. When the others realize that he’s different, they leave. Our character tries making friends in the same way, but after a while everyone dislikes him because they do not know him.</p>
                            <p>.../Soft and Squishy uses an aesthetic of “cute aggression” — the sensation of squishing something when you encounter something cute — to seemingly appeal to children but also to many other generations.</p>

                <p>Rian Ishikawa is a  Parsons to study Design and Technology. She strongly believes technology is what we need to explore in the world we all live in right now because digital art has the capacity to expand the idea of art . Art has been about the relationship between the artist to physical materials to viewers and something that once made and would be unchangeable other than decaying throughout time. But with digital art, artists can explore and represent them self freely not tied to the physical world. Digital technology could expand the space freely so it is possible to manipulate the space and send an idea and message of the artwork more directly to the audience.</p>
